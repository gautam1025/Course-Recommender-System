üöÄ Key Features

    üìÑ Automated Resume Parsing: Upload a resume in PDF format and have it automatically parsed.
    üß† Intelligent Skill Extraction: A spaCy-based NLP service extracts key information like skills, job titles,experience, and degrees.
    üéØ Context-Aware Recommendations: The engine provides different suggestions based on user goals:
        . Upskill: Recommends courses that build upon existing skills (relevance-based).
        . Domain Switch: Suggests foundational courses for a new career path (novelty-based).
    üìö Multi-Source Course Aggregation: Dynamically fetches courses from Udemy, Coursera, and YouTube APIs with a static JSON fallback for reliability.
    üó∫Ô∏è Structured Career Roadmaps: Provides a step-by-step learning path for popular career tracks like Data Science and Full Stack Development.
    üìä Interactive Dashboard: A clean, modern UI built with React to visualize the user's extracted profile, recommended courses, and career path progress.



üèõÔ∏è Technical Architecture

    This project is built using a microservice architecture to separate concerns and ensure scalability. The system is composed of two main backend services:

    Node.js / Express.js (API Gateway): The primary backend that handles user requests, manages data aggregation from course APIs, and communicates with the NLP service.
    Python / FastAPI (NLP Service): A specialized microservice dedicated to the computationally intensive task of parsing PDFs and performing Named Entity Recognition (NER) with spaCy.
    This design allows the core application to remain fast and responsive while offloading heavy processing to a service built with the best tools for the job (Python's data science ecosystem).

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

    1. Resume Upload: The user uploads their resume via the React frontend.
    2. Text Extraction: The Node.js backend receives the file, extracts raw text using pdf-parse, and sends it to the NLP service.
    3. NLP Processing: The FastAPI service uses a custom spaCy NER model to process the text and returns a structured JSON object containing extracted skills, degrees, job titles, etc.
    4. Course Aggregation: The Node.js backend fetches course data from various APIs (Udemy, Coursera, YouTube), normalizes it into a common schema, and caches it.
    5. Recommendation Engine: Based on the user's profile and stated goal (upskill/domain switch), the engine scores and ranks the available courses.
    6. Dashboard Display: The final ranked courses and a relevant career roadmap are sent to the React frontend to be displayed on the user's personalized dashboard.
